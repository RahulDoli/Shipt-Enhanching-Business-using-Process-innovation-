In this project, I implemented the VLIFT strategy, incorporating Lean and Six Sigma methodologies to enhance customer value and service profitability through process innovation. I analyzed the current state, identifying gaps in delivery times, app usability, grocery quality, and communication and stock issues. I devised strategies to address these gaps, leveraging technology and process improvements to enhance delivery efficiency, app functionality, and product quality. This approach aimed to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, positioning us for sustainable growth and increased market share.
